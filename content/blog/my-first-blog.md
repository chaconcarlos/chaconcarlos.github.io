Hello world! So I guess finally I got this blogging thing up and rolling. I guess on the top of my head, my main objective is to have a registry of my thoughts, make some guides that could helpful for mostly software (and maybe other things), and have a place to look back at the things that have happened in my life, sorta like a diary. Also, I think writing could something useful for me, at least to learn to express myself better.

Well, let's start this thing!
